# Graph Network
This code buils and analyzes a graph network of the first three books of the series "The Wheel of Time", to understand the evolving relevance of characters across them. For each book, it identifies character mentions, extracts relationships between characters appearing within a short window of text, and builds a graph network based on these relationships. It also calculates the degree centrality, betweeness and closeteness, for each character. Finally, it compiles the degree centrality data for the top overall characters across all books and generates a line graph showing how the caracthers importance changes throught the three books.

IMPORTANT:The html graph visualization was specically build for Windows, so it might need to be change in order to run on macOS or Linux.
